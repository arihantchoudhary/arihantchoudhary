# Hi, I'm Arihant.
I learn, fail, debug and build fast. I try to be consistent and deliver measurable results (still pending for a lot of my projects) 

Brewing LLMs. Currently building:
1. Personal Edcuator for Intel
2. AI Coding Agent to automate workflow between PRD->TDD->Jira->Github for Google TPMs with Lauren Bilbo
3. Document Analyzer converting Process Documents to Flow Diagrams
4. Voice AI enabled Deep Research Assistant
5. Swipeable Tweets on the Blockchain with Parth Behani
6. Supply Chain and Trade Management (Reasonning + Planning) Agent for TSMC and Middle Eastern Traders (Prof. Chang and Adam Virani)
7. AI that attends meetings for me so I can build 1-6 peacefully (using Delphi)
